# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for

# you're doing.
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty32"

  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
  # config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  config.vm.network "public_network"

  # If true, then any SSH connections made will enable agent forwarding.
  # Default value: false
  config.ssh.forward_agent = true

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  config.vm.synced_folder "./app/", "/var/www/django-app/"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
  #   vb.memory = "1024"
    
    ### Change network card to PCnet-FAST III
    # For NAT adapter
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--nictype1", "Am79C973"]
    # For host-only adapter
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--nictype2", "Am79C973"]

  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Define a Vagrant Push strategy for pushing to Atlas. Other push strategies
  # such as FTP and Heroku are also available. See the documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/push/atlas.html for more information.
  config.push.define "heroku" do |push|
    push.app = "mdb-portfolio"
  end

  # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
  # Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, and Docker are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    sudo apt-get update

    ### Create configuration for host-only adapter. In my case eth1
    # Clear previous setting
    rm -f /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1.cfg
    # Create new setting
    echo "auto eth1" >> /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1.cfg
    echo "iface eth1 inet static" >> /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1.cfg
    # ip address should be the same as in a private_network
    echo "address 192.168.35.25" >> /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1.cfg
    echo "netmask 255.255.255.0" >> /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1.cfg
    # Restart adapter for apply new setting
    ifdown eth1 && ifup eth1

  # Install required software, dependencies and configurations on the
  # virtual machine using a provisioner.
